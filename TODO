-- Rename Categorical.from_strings (misleading name)

-- Instead of having an explicit list of stateful transformations,
   perhaps we should look up each called function in the environment,
   and check for some sort of magic attribute like
     __charlton_stateful_transformation__
   However, we could only do this for functions that are easily
   recognizable as such in the token stream (e.g., bare function
   calls, like currently.)
   It'd also be nice if stateful transforms *could* be called like
   functions when desired -- the current API is just a bit clunky all
   around. Another approach for R basically uses regular functions
   with a dynamically scoped state:
     http://www.stat.auckland.ac.nz/~yee/smartpred/TechnicalGuide.txt
   But, I don't see how this could work if we want to support nested
   calls and incremental data. Nonetheless, this is perhaps the only
   way to avoid making stateful transforms "obvious" in the formula.

   I guess the other option would be to use 'ast' to reliably pull out
   all function calls of any kind, and execute them one at a
   time. But that would bump our version requirement to 2.5 (_ast is
   probably good enough).

-- We can use charlton.eval.capture_environment() to evaluate formula
   expressions in the context where they were written. But, this does
   not capture which __future__ flags were in effect. In particular,
   "y ~ I(a / b)" will currently never use proper division, even if
   the caller did 'from __future__ import division'. Can we correct
   this? compile() takes an argument that lets us say which __future__
   flags to use. I think that the .f_code.co_flags field on frame
   objects lets us see what __future__ flags were in use in some
   calling frame (http://docs.python.org/reference/datamodel.html,
   search for "co_flags"). And eval() can take code objects (this is
   not documented but it works). (NB this is also how you execute ast
   code after you have fiddled with it -- compile() takes ast code.)

-- As a safety check for non-stateful transforms, maybe we should
   always evaluate each formula on just the first row of data alone,
   and make sure the result matches what we got when evaluating it
   vectorized (i.e., confirm f(x[0]) == f(x)[0], where f is our
   transform.

-- Some more *non*-magic builtin utilities
   -- I()
   -- get(string) for data names that aren't valid Python identifiers?
      (is there a better name? Q()? G()?)
   -- the contrast makers

-- More contrast coding methods:
   -- Helmert (NB there is some disagreement about what's called Helmert
      vs. what's called reverse Helmert)
   -- Forward difference (probably should be the default for ordered factors)
   -- Maybe 'deviation coding' (everything against grand mean)
   -- Some sort of symbolic tools for user-defined contrasts -- take
      the comparisons that people want to compute in terms of linear
      combinations of level names, convert that to a matrix and do the
      pinv dance?

-- Some way to specify the default contrast

-- Should we have a way to do "centered" contrasts? (Ask Klinton about
   this.)

-- (Currently we ignore whether the levels of categorical data are
   ordered. Should that change?)

-- Support for the magic "." term
   -- The "y ~ everything else" form
   -- The "what I had in this other ModelDesc" form (e.g., "y ~ . - a"
      to drop the 'a' predictor from an old model)

-- Make sure we can handle all the different data holding objects that
   people like to use (dict, recarray, pandas, larry...)

-- ability to specify the dtype of the model matrix?

-- More stateful transforms:
   -- Splines
   -- 'cut': numeric->factor by quantile dichotimization
   -- Orthogonal polynomials
   -- 'code': takes a Categorical (or coerces to one), and optionally
      a contrast, and and does the standard contrast-coding. And
      possibly this should replace _CatFactorEvaluator...

-- Ability to eliminate rows due to NaN/mask/missing data handling
   (shouldn't be too bad, do it in make_model_matrices).
   -- And then extend make_model_matrices to handle other "parallel"
      data, like weights, which need to participate in the missingness
      calculation.

-- Better NaN/masks/missing data handling in transforms. I think the
   current ones will just blow up if there are any NaNs.

-- For large data being loaded in chunks, the ModelDesc->ModelSpec
   code will load at least the first chunk to do type inference and
   work out the shape of the model matrix. If there are any
   categorical variables with an unknown number of levels, then it
   will have to do a full pass through the data at this point. But if
   there aren't, then it will look at only the first chunk, and then
   throw it away, and then when we build the model matrix we will load
   that chunk again. In practice this is not a huge problem (instead
   of loading n chunks, we load n+1, where n is presumably large, plus
   loading that first chunk twice in row will exploit whatever caching
   is present), but we could do a bit better in this case by saving
   the first chunk and the started iterator and using them to produce
   the first chunk of model matrix.

-- It might also be useful to have a mode for large data that says
   "please do only one pass or else error out"

-- Real testing/support for extending the evaluation machinery

-- A good way to support magic functions like mgcv's s().

-- Profiling/optimization. There are lots of places where I use lazy
   quadratic algorithms (or even exponential, in the case of the
   non-redundant coding stuff). Perhaps worse is the heavy
   multiplication used unconditionally to load data into the model
   matrix. I'm pretty sure that at least most of the quadratic stuff
   doesn't matter because it's n^2 where n is something like the
   number of factors in an interaction term (and who has hundreds of
   factors interacting in one term?), but it wouldn't hurt to run some
   profiles to check.

-- Support for building sparse model matrices directly. (This should
   be pretty straightforward when it comes to exploiting the intrinsic
   sparsity of categorical factors; numeric factors that evaluate to a
   sparse matrix directly might be slightly more complicated.)

-- Possible optimization: let a stateful transform's memorize_chunk
   function raise Stateless to indicate that actually, ha-ha, it turns
   out that it doesn't need to memorize anything after all (b/c the
   relevant data turns out to be specified explicitly in *args,
   **kwargs)
